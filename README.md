# Giphy-API
Giphy API Homework by CaraFelise

This page diplays plants and trees gifs from Giphy Developers in the results section. It connects to Giphy API to get JSON object of gifs which the page displays. There are preset topics(plants and trees) you can select from or you can add more. When you click on an image it plays the gif or stop it. There is a favorites section where you can add or remove any image from the results. The page also displays weather information for the current day and user location in map. The weather information is from Open Weather Map API and the map is from Google Maps API.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using AJAX, JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@carafelise.com. I maintain and developed this project.
